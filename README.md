# GifTastic
Used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic page that populates the page gifs based off of the buttons you click.  

## How it works
Clicking the buttons will populate a set of gifs to be displayed from top to bottom. Each item that comes in is based off of the topic of the button name.  Two things to note: 1. Each GIF that comes in will be static, once you click the image the GIF will play.  2. You can determine how many GIFs get displayed by setting the number on the right hand side.  The default is 10.

## Search
You can search for the topic or title in the search box.  Searching for an item will create the button also, to have quick access so you may search for it again.

## Technology Used:
  * Javascript AJAX calls
  * Giphy API
